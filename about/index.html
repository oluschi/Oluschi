         <p> My name is <a href="../index.html" >  <b>Oluschi Harmon</b> </a>

            , and I'm a graduate from Parsons School of Design in NYC, with a Bachelor's degree in Communication Design and a minor in Fashion Communication. <br></br>

            As a graphic designer, my philosophy is centered around a quote by Elsie de Wolfe <i>“I am going to make everything around me beautiful, that will be my life”.</i><br></br>

             I aim to create visually compelling designs that not only meet the needs of my clients but also enrich the lives of those who encounter them. I invite you to take a look at my design portfolio, which showcases my skills and creativity. Thank you for your time and consideration.  <br>
